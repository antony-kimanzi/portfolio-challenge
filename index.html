          <h2>My Journey in Software Engineering</h2>
          <p>
            I am Currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, I will
            have the opportunity to dive deep into areas such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Understanding
              core OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and
              encapsulation has helped me structure my code in a clean, modular
              way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Structures & Algorithms:</strong> Learning about
              arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and implementing algorithms
              like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming is one of my
              favorite challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Software Design Patterns:</strong> Using design patterns
              like Singleton, Observer, and Factory to write scalable,
              maintainable code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Database Management:</strong> I have worked with both SQL
              (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, designing
              schemas for efficient data retrieval and management.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Development:</strong> Front-end development with HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript (React) and back-end development using Node.js and
              Express, ensuring full-stack capability. üåê
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Version Control (Git):</strong> Collaborating on group
              projects using GitHub for source control and learning how to
              manage branches, pull requests, and merging code with teammates.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

            <li>
              <strong>Overweight Alert System Dashboard:</strong> Built a dashboard that fetches
              real-time data from an API to display the weight carried by a delivery truck plus the trucks performance.
